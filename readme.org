This package provides a minor mode for formatting an Emacs buffer as
slides. This package relies on =narrowed-page-navigation-mode= to
actually navigate from slide to slide, and instead provides syntax for
comments that are rendered as slide elements.

The syntax comes pre-configured for Idris or Haskell. For other
languages, set =live-code-talks-title-regexp=,
=live-code-talks-image-regexp=, and =live-code-talks-comment-regexp=,
preferably as file variables.  For your presentation, consider also
overriding =face-remapping-alist= to get the proper fonts for your
screen.
